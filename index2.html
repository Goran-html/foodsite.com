          <h4>Why is healthy food so important?</h4>

          <h5 id="bigtext">Healthy food is considered healthy primarily because it provides essential nutrients that support various bodily functions and promote overall well-being. Here are some key reasons why healthy food is beneficial:Nutrient Density: Healthy foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and nuts are typically rich in essential nutrients like vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber. These nutrients are vital for the proper functioning of the body, including metabolism, immune function, and tissue repair.
          Supporting Body Functions: A balanced diet with healthy foods ensures that your body gets the right combination of nutrients to perform its daily tasks efficiently. For example, calcium and vitamin D are crucial for bone health, while omega-3 fatty acids support heart health.
          Disease Prevention: Certain healthy foods are associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.
          <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> For instance, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables can help lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart disease.
          Weight Management: Healthy foods are often lower in calories and saturated fats compared to processed and unhealthy foods. Eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins can help maintain a healthy weight and reduce the risk of obesity.
          Digestive Health: Foods high in fiber, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, promote healthy digestion and prevent constipation. Fiber also helps regulate blood sugar levels and may contribute to a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
          Mental Health: Some nutrients found in healthy foods, such as omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants, may have positive effects on mental health and cognitive function. A balanced diet can contribute to better mood and overall mental well-being.
          Energy Levels: Healthy foods provide a steady source of energy throughout the day. Complex carbohydrates found in whole grains and fruits, combined with proteins and fats, provide sustained energy without causing rapid spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels.</h5>

          <h2>The influence of a healthy diet on the psyche</h2>
          <p>A healthy diet can have a significant influence on the psyche, affecting mental health and overall well-being in several ways:
            Nutrient Impact: Nutrients found in healthy foods, such as omega-3 fatty acids (found in fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts), B vitamins (found in whole grains and leafy greens), and antioxidants (found in fruits and vegetables), play crucial roles in brain function and mental health. For example, omega-3 fatty acids are important for maintaining brain structure and function, while B vitamins help regulate mood and energy levels.
            Gut-Brain Connection: There is growing evidence of the gut-brain axis, which suggests that the health of our gut microbiota (the community of bacteria in our intestines) can influence brain function and mental health. Healthy foods that support a diverse and balanced gut microbiota, such as fiber-rich fruits and vegetables, fermented foods (like yogurt and kimchi), and probiotics, may positively impact mood and cognition.
            Stabilizing Blood Sugar Levels: A diet rich in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables helps maintain stable blood sugar levels throughout the day. Fluctuations in blood sugar can affect mood and energy levels, contributing to feelings of irritability, fatigue, and anxiety.
            Inflammation Reduction: Chronic inflammation has been linked to depression and other mood disorders. Healthy foods, particularly those rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds (such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, and fatty fish), can help reduce inflammation in the body and potentially improve mood.Impact on Stress Response: Certain nutrients, such as magnesium (found in nuts, seeds, and leafy greens), play a role in regulating the body's stress response. A balanced diet that includes these nutrients may help buffer the effects of stress and improve resilience.Improving Sleep Quality: Diet can influence sleep patterns, and poor sleep is closely linked to mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. Foods rich in tryptophan (an amino acid precursor to serotonin, a neurotransmitter involved in mood regulation and sleep), such as turkey, nuts, and seeds, may promote better sleep quality when consumed as part of a balanced diet.Overall Well-Being: When the body receives adequate nutrition from a variety of healthy foods, it operates more efficiently, which can lead to increased energy levels, better concentration, and a greater sense of overall well-being. This, in turn, can positively impact mood and mental outlook.</p>

            Our two buildings, the cafe and the restaurant, have many workers in various positions. Here I will exclusively talk about those on whom the quality of our products that we deliver or serve you depends. The staff I am referring to are waiters, bartenders, cooks, cleaners. in the kitchen, we have one main one who is similar to him and 2 or 3 young people who come from cooking and tourism schools for internships. With us, the same high school students can also work through the youth center during the weekend or during some holidays.<span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more2">All our workers are very young and that was one of the requirements when they were employed, for the reason that young people are more patient, more careful, and that is what is very important in this kind of work, especially when this kind of work has to do with healthy eating So far, no one has complained about the dirty a table, a dirty cup, no shortage of sugar on the table or straws in the cup with pizza served with straws, people mostly complained about waiting a little for pizza or food because of the crowd, but you must know that at those moments they are working with the head chef and young people in the kitchen as well as with the head waiter. In those situations, we teach high school students who come to us for internships about what will await them later in this job.
